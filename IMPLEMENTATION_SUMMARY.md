## 📝 Notes for Deployment

### Supabase Setup Steps:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create three public buckets:
   - Name: `avatars`, Public: Yes
   - Name: `artworks`, Public: Yes
   - Name: `exhibitions`, Public: Yes
3. Set bucket policies to allow public read access

### Database Indexes (Recommended):
```javascript
// MongoDB indexes for performance
db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 }, { unique: true });
db.users.createIndex({ "role": 1, "is_approved": 1, "is_active": 1 });
db.users.createIndex({ "teaching_rate": 1, "teaches_online": 1, "teaches_offline": 1 });
db.artworks.createIndex({ "artist_id": 1, "is_approved": 1 });
db.exhibitions.createIndex({ "status": 1, "is_approved": 1 });
db.exhibitions.createIndex({ "archived_at": 1, "archive_expires_at": 1 });
db.art_class_enquiries.createIndex({ "user_id": 1, "created_at": -1 });
db.art_class_enquiries.createIndex({ "expires_at": 1 }); // For TTL
```

### Known Limitations:
1. Auto-archiving requires scheduled task (not implemented yet)
2. ImageUpload component not yet integrated into forms
3. Sub-admin dashboards need UI implementation
4. Exhibition creation form needs pricing tier selector

---

## 🎯 Priority Next Steps

1. **Create Supabase Storage Buckets** (5 minutes)
2. **Integrate ImageUpload into Artist Profile** (30 minutes)
3. **Add Exhibition Pricing Selector to Form** (20 minutes)
4. **Test Art Class Enquiry Flow** (15 minutes)
5. **Create Test Artists with Teaching Profiles** (10 minutes)

---

## 🐛 Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Supabase CORS**: If file uploads fail, check Supabase CORS settings
2. **Image Size**: 5MB limit might be too small for high-res artwork
3. **Enquiry Matching**: Need real artists with teaching profiles to test
4. **Archive Expiry**: Requires cron job or scheduled task for automation
5. **Contact Reveal**: Phone numbers must be collected during signup/profile update
